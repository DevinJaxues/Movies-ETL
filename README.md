Our purpose in this challenge was to practice the Extract, Transform and Load process using multiple different data sources. This would make a PostrgreSQL dataset that hackathon atendee's could continue to work on. Unfortunately challenge 3 and 4 caused me too much headache that I am unable to diagnose due to being behind on next weeks work because of this. I also got lost about where the resource files were supposed to come from. But once again, have to keep pushing forward cause a low score is better than a 0.
